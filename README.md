Click the icon in the top bar.

### Going Forward

Positions, Communications, and the other note types all work the same way. 

Good luck out there!

## Tips and Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
Do not rename the Vault. If you do, the navigation buttons won't work.
If extensions and formatting did not load: Make sure you opened the Job_Hunt_Vault folder as a Vault. Make sure you trusted the extensions and are not in Restricted mode.

### Customization
You can edit the Lists in 00 Settings > 10 Lists to suit your needs
If you want to rename the Vault: After changing the Vault name: Open 00 Settings > 99 Technical > Buttons.md. Find and replace Job_Hunt_Vault with the new Vault name.
